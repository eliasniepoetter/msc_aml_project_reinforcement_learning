# Applied Machine Learning - Semester Project
Group projetc for the 6 ECTS masters degree lecture, necessary for the exam registration.
The goal is to design a flight controller through reinforcement leanring methods.
Pytorch is used as the main package for the reinforcement learning implementation.
